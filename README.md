# Weather App

With this weather app I learnt how to use APIs to fetch data in real time, resulting in a dynamically updating web app.

While barebones, this app does have the functionality to provide three days of weather forecasts using the OpenWeather API.  A challenge I faced was that openweather provides data in three hour intervals, which I resolved by taking the 8th interval, as there are eight sets of three hours in a day.

In any case, this could do with some styling, but as a proof of concept and learning experience I am happy with it.

Needless to say should you wish to use this code you will need to get your own API key from openweather.
